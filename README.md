# HackerRank Projects

Different challenges that I have solved from HackerRank to improve my coding skills and pass time.

------------

### What is HackerRank?
HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

### Keep in mind
- I'm providing the link to the original challenges on a READMME.md file inside each challenge;
- Normally the functions done by me are either the first one on a given project or most if not all of the main one on any given project. The rest of the code is provided by HackerRank and not part of the challenge;
- Includes might be missing. HackerRank does not require any includes to be added (with the exception of the top one);
- I haven't added the std namespace to the projects. This one it's included by default.
